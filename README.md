This project is a final exam for c# courses.

It is an ASP.NET Core SPA app which can encrypt/decrypt strings of text with Vigenere cipher. There's only one window where all actions can be done, you can toggle between encrypt/decrypt states of app, select a file (.txt, .docx) or enter a string of text manually, insert a key and get your result. If result form is not empty you can download its contents as docx or txt file.

App converts only Ciryllic symbols.

Have fun!
